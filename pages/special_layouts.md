This theme has a few special layouts. 

## FAQ layout

See the faq.html page for an example of the FAQ format, which follows an accordion, collapse/expand format. This code is from Bootstrap.

## Knowledgebase layout

See the kb_layout.md for a possible layout for knowledge base articles. This layout looks for pages containing specific tags.

## Scroll layout

If you have a long JSON message you're documenting, see the scroll.html layout. This layout adds a side pane showing links to pointers in the left pane. 

## Shuffle layout

If you want a dynamic card layout that allows you to filter the cards, see shuffle.html. This uses the Shuffle JS library.

## Code for special layouts

Special layouts include the JS files they need directly in the page. The JavaScript for each special layout does not load by default for every page in the site.
