# Step 1: Running Locally

Before you start, we recommend checking out our [Kilonova/Valkyr documentation](https://kilonova.kbuild.msap.io/valkyr/started.html). Using it will make your Dockerfile much simpler.

The following tasks have to be accomplished to complete this step:

1. [Create the Dockerfile](../getting-started/dockerfile.md) to build the docker image.

1. [Create the Helm chart](helm.md).

1. Run the app in [KIND](run-in-kind.md).
