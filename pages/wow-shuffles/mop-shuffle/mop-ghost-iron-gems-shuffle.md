# Overview
{% include tip.html content="This is personally one of my favorite shuffles. It unlocks mounts which sell very quickly! This will allow you to price check the value potential from prospecting Ghost Iron stacks into raw mats which goes into Panther Mounts and JC MOP gem cuts which profits vary server to server and region to region."%}

## Prerequisites for the Shuffle
In order to do this shuffle you must:

* Get **MOP Jewelcrafting** from [Mai the Jade Shaper](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=65098/mai-the-jade-shaper)
* Unlock **Panther Mounts** for your JewelCrafter. There is a plethora of videos. Here is an example [one](https://youtu.be/egzXdQd1G7s)
* Max out **MOP JC** and learn the **available JC patterns**. They sell in frequently. Make just one of each and post on the AH. IMO, JC Panther mounts is the money maker, dont be confused!

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Buy off the **AH** or farm the **Ghost Iron Ore**. IMO buy cheap always. Time is money friend!
2.  Use **Canadia_TV's Google Sheets Calculator** (posted at the bottom) to understand profit margins.
3.  Prospect Prospect Prospect! Macro is down below in Reference Links.
4.  Craft Craft Craft Craft! I would recommend TSM Crafting Operation at this point. Customize to your **personal preference.**
```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of the following:

* **Panthers** are generally a saturated market... Be ready to not post Panthers if the markets disp to an unprofitable margin based off your preference. You can do this manually or update your **TSM Auction Op** to not post at that threshold.
* Do the **Daily quests** to earn Panthers easily and casually. You can see some of those details [here](https://youtu.be/egzXdQd1G7s)
* **Scan the auction house daily, regularly** for cheap [Ghost Iron Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/item=72092/ghost-iron-ore)
* **Scan the auction house daily, regularly** for cheap [Spirits of Harmony](https://www.wowhead.com/item=76061/spirit-of-harmony). [Horde Spirit of Harmony Vendor](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=66685/danky) and [Alliance Spirit of Harmony vendor](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=66678/krystel) are listed there to trade spirits for **Ghost Iron Ore**.
