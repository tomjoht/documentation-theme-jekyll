# You can store various options here, such as audience. Then you can access the option with {{site.data.options.audience}}. 
# This allows you to do conditional logic. Options you set here work similarly to options set in the configuration file, 
# but the advantage here is that you don't have to restart the jekyll server to see changes. Also note that you access this location
# using site.data instead of just site. And the location of data is defined in the configuration file through the data-source property. 

# Sample logic: 
# {% if {{site.data.options.widget_toggle}} == "mac" %}
# do this for mac
# {% elsif {{site.data.options.widget_toggle}} == "pc" %}
# do this for pc
# {% endif %}

# This logic works in Markdown and HTML. You can compress onto the same line if the spacing creates issues in Markdown.

widget_toggle: mac
